Objective: The project implements a chatbot using a sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder architecture with LSTM layers. It can process input questions and generate meaningful responses.

Data Handling: Conversational data is stored in YAML files, and the Tokenize class handles data preprocessingâ€”tokenizing questions and answers, cleaning invalid entries, and adding special tags (<start> and <end>).

Input Preparation: The Dataprepration class generates padded and tokenized inputs for the encoder and decoder, creating suitable data for the model. One-hot encoding is also applied to decoder outputs for training.

Model Architecture: The Encoder_Decoder class defines an LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence model with embedding layers for word representation. The encoder processes input sequences and produces states, which the decoder uses to predict output sequences.

Training: The model is trained on conversational data using the RMSprop optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. Epochs and batch size are customizable for performance tuning.

Inference Models: Separate inference models (make_inference_models) are created for the encoder and decoder, enabling real-time conversation. The encoder processes user input and generates states, while the decoder predicts responses one timestep at a time.

Inference Workflow: The chatbot processes user questions by tokenizing input, encoding it with the inference encoder, and decoding responses sequentially using the decoder. A stop condition ends the loop when the response is complete.

Interactive Chat: The chatbot interface allows users to input questions via the terminal. Responses are generated dynamically based on the trained model.

Scalability: The architecture is modular, allowing for easy integration of new data, modification of hyperparameters, or switching to more advanced models.

Practical Applications: This chatbot can be extended for various real-world applications like customer support, personal assistants, or educational tools by training it on domain-specific data.
